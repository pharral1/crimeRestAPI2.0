Database needs:
	Two tables:
		crimes - populated, see model for detail
		crimes_django - empty
	User:
		APIUser
		Granted privileges all on both tables
Django needs:
	User config for the granted user in settings.py in the project folder
	Created model for the db in models.py made by command manage.py inspectdb --database=crimes
	Router in crimeRestAPI that route to either django controlled default db or to the crime database depending on query
